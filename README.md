# skin_classifier_init
A demo skin disease classifier made with Fastai, ipywidgets and Voila.

It uses a very simple interface to upload images of skin disorders and it will output its best classification and probability.

At this point, it only can recognize the following skin diseases:

1. 'allergic contact dermatitis',
2. 'lichen planus',
3. 'pityriasis rosea',
4. 'psoriasis',
5. 'actinic keratosis',
6. 'seborrheic dermatitis',
7. 'acne',
8. 'rosacea',
9. 'basal cell carcinoma',
10. 'eczema',
11. 'urticaria'
 
 This is a very primitive trial just to see if things are working as they should
