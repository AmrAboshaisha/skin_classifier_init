# skin_classifier_init
A simple skin disease classifier made with Fastai, ipywidgets and Voila.
It uses a very simple interface to upload images of skin disorders and it will output its best classification and probability.
At this point, it only can recognize the following skin diseases:
'allergic contact dermatitis',
 'lichen planus',
 'pityriasis rosea',
 'psoriasis',
 'actinic keratosis',
 'seborrheic dermatitis',
 'acne',
 'rosacea',
 'basal cell carcinoma',
 'eczema',
 'urticaria'
 
 This is a very primitive trial just to see if things are working as they should
